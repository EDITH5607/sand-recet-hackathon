        "It creates the Virtual Payment Address (VPA) for the customer."
      ],
      "answer": "It acts as the central network or backbone that routes payment requests between the different banks.",
      "explanation": "The transcript describes the NPCI as the 'backbone of UPI' ([162.52]) and the network that receives requests from the PSP, communicates with the payer's and payee's banks, and facilitates the direct transfer ([211.72-224.12])."

      "id": 4,
      "question": "How does the transcript distinguish UPI's function from that of a traditional payment gateway or payment processor?",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "options": [
        "UPI is defined as both a payment gateway and a payment processor, just like PayPal.",
        "UPI functions as a payment infrastructure or system, rather than a gateway that authorizes payments or a processor that handles the transfer itself.",
        "UPI is a payment gateway because it acts like a checkout counter, but it is not a processor.",
        "UPI is a payment processor because it uses credit card networks like Visa, unlike a payment gateway."
      ],
      "answer": "UPI functions as a payment infrastructure or system, rather than a gateway that authorizes payments or a processor that handles the transfer itself.",
      "explanation": "The transcript explicitly states at [123.52-128.36] that 'UPI is neither strictly a payment processor nor a payment Gateway. It functions more as a payment infrastructure or system that facilitates real-time bank-to-bank transfers'."
