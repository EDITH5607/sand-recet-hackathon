      "question": "The transcript repeatedly juxtaposes the singer's awareness of the listener's feelings ('Your heart's been aching') with the listener's inaction. What does this suggest about the relationship's dynamic?",

      "explanation": "The singer claims to know the 'rules' and what the listener is feeling ('Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it'). This implies the singer believes the feelings are mutual but is taking the lead to bridge the communication gap caused by the listener's shyness, rather than being frustrated or seeing the relationship as one-sided."
