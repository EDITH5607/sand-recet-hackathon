[0.16 - 5.36] unified payments interface or UPI has 
revolutionized real-time payments in India  
[5.36 - 11.80] it&#39;s fast secure and available 247 allowing you to 
instantly send money just using your mobile number  
[11.80 - 18.20] or UPA ID no more complex Bank details or delays 
UPI transfers money directly between bank accounts  
[18.20 - 24.84] in real time and best of all UPI is free for users 
unlike PayPal which charges fees for transaction  
[24.84 - 30.44] especially International ones in today&#39;s video 
we break down how UPI Works in digital payments  
[30.44 - 34.76] compare it with Global Systems like 
PayPal alip venbo and zel and wrap up  
[34.76 - 37.96] by exploring where India&#39;s UPI 
fits into the Global Payments
[37.96 - 46.16] ecosystem traditionally if you wanted to send 
money to someone&#39;s bank account you would need  
[46.16 - 52.84] to know their bank account number the Bank name 
the branch name and the ifsc code which is like a  
[52.84 - 59.36] postal code for banks in India UPI simplifies all 
of this it&#39;s like sending a letter but instead of  
[59.36 - 65.48] a full address you just need a short code called 
a UPI ID or even just their mobile number and  
[65.48 - 70.40] the system takes care of the rest in seconds 
the money reaches the right account what sets  
[70.40 - 74.88] UPI apart from other system is that it doesn&#39;t 
hold your funds in a middle lay like a digital  
[74.88 - 81.12] wallet before they are transferred UPI enables 
realtime bank to bank transfers directly from  
[81.12 - 87.04] one account to another it&#39;s not just secure it&#39;s 
efficient and cost free for users now before we  
[87.04 - 91.52] get into the comparisons let me remind you that 
I have previous L made a video explaining how  
[91.52 - 96.72] payment gateways and payment process work so do 
check that out for a more detailed breakdown of  
[96.72 - 102.20] how different payment Technologies operate behind 
the scenes but at a high level think of a payment  
[102.20 - 107.80] Gateway like a checkout counter at a store it 
authorizes and processes your payment whether  
[107.80 - 112.88] you are using a card or bank account the payment 
processor on the other hand handles the behind  
[112.88 - 117.96] the-scenes work actually transferring the money 
between your account and the Merchant&#39;s account  
[117.96 - 123.52] PayPal and stripe are examples of both UPI 
is neither strictly a payment processor nor  
[123.52 - 128.36] a payment Gateway it functions more as 
a payment infrastructure or system that  
[128.36 - 133.28] facilitates real-time bank-to-bank transfers it&#39;s 
an interbank payment system built by the national  
[133.28 - 140.08] payments Corporation of India or npci UPI acts as 
a network allowing realtime transfers between bank  
[140.08 - 145.12] accounts using a mobile phone it doesn&#39;t really 
process payments in the traditional sense like a  
[145.12 - 150.68] credit card processor such as Visa or Mastercard 
rather it facilitates Direct in instantaneous bank  
[150.68 - 155.88] to bank transfers this diagram explains the flow 
of UPI transaction let&#39;s say you are using Google  
[155.88 - 162.52] pay when you initiate a transfer Google pay talks 
to your bank let&#39;s say IC Bank in India through  
[162.52 - 168.96] something called the npci which is the backbone 
of UPI npci then checks if everything is okay  
[168.96 - 173.80] like whether you have enough balance and ensures 
the money moves directly from your account to the  
[173.80 - 180.56] recipient&#39;s bank account say HDFC Bank in India 
and that to within seconds let let&#39;s further break  
[180.56 - 187.88] it down step by step say the payer or the customer 
opens their PSP app now a PSP or payment service  
[187.88 - 194.24] provider helps connect customers with their Bank 
to complete transactions for instance in India  
[194.24 - 199.68] Google pay acts as a PSP so when you initiate a 
payment it interacts with your bank to process  
[199.68 - 205.48] it securely in fact Google&#39;s UPI app is linked 
with various Bank similarly phone pay in India  
[205.48 - 211.72] was linked with yes Bank as PSP initially now IC 
Bank in India once authenticated the payers PSP  
[211.72 - 218.04] sends a payment request to the UPI Network npci 
this request includes the payers and pays UPI  
[218.04 - 224.12] IDs and the payment details the UPI Network first 
resolves the pay address mapping it to their bank  
[224.12 - 231.08] account via their PSP the pays PSP verifies the 
pays details and responds back the UPI Network  
[231.08 - 237.20] then sends a debit request to the payers Bank also 
known as the remitter or issuer Bank asking for  
[237.20 - 241.92] authorization to dedu the specified amount from 
the pay account the issuer bank processes the  
[241.92 - 247.28] debit request checking if the paer has sufficient 
funds and if the transaction is valid it sends a  
[247.28 - 253.04] confirmation response back to the UPI Network and 
after receiving the confirmation the UPI Network  
[253.04 - 258.20] sends a credit request to the beneficiaries Bank 
also called the pays Bank informing it to credit  
[258.20 - 262.92] the amount into the pays account the beneficiary 
Bank processes the credit request and confirms  
[262.92 - 267.56] the successful transfer to the UPI Network the 
network then release the successful transaction  
[267.56 - 275.12] status back to both the payers PSP and the pay 
PSP completing the transaction in simpler terms  
[275.12 - 280.80] UPI is the infrastructure that Banks and apps like 
Google pay or phone pay use to directly move money  
[280.80 - 286.56] between accounts UPI is not a digital wallet 
either money is transferred directly between  
[286.56 - 291.56] bank accounts whereas in digital wallets funds 
are stored in an intermediate balance before  
[291.56 - 296.44] being used for one more important thing in this 
UPA diagram is that the customer also creates a  
[296.44 - 302.16] virtual payment address or vpa through the PSP app 
which links directly to their bank account once  
[302.16 - 308.04] confirmed the vpa allows secure payments without 
sharing sensitive Bank details for QR code based  
[308.04 - 314.24] payments the customer scans the QR code which 
contains the pay vpa or details it authorizes  
[314.24 - 320.00] the payment with their NP in or mobile pin and 
the request is sent to the UPI network via the  
[320.00 - 326.20] PSP following the regular transaction flow now UPI 
operates through an API based architecture every  
[326.20 - 333.16] time you use apps like Google pay phone pay or 
PTM in India these apps are calling NPC apis these  
[333.16 - 338.88] apis do everything from verifying user identities 
through UPI pins to making sure the money lands  
[338.88 - 344.00] in the correct account once that is done the 
transaction is confirmed by both the senders and  
[344.00 - 349.32] receivers Banks all in a blink of an eye behind 
the scenes Banks act as payment service providers  
[349.32 - 355.28] or PSPs so for instance when you use Google pay 
IC Bank might be processing the transaction as  
[355.28 - 361.00] its PSP while phone pay might partner with yes 
Bank this banks handle your request and interact  
[361.00 - 367.32] with NPC&#39;s platform to complete the transfers to 
understand how UPI fits into the bigger picture  
[367.32 - 372.36] let&#39;s compare it to other widely used Payment 
Systems around the world each of the systems has  
[372.36 - 377.88] a slightly different structure but they all aim 
to provide seamless money transfers and here is  
[377.88 - 384.32] how they Stack Up PayPal is a household name in 
the Global Payments landscape serving as digital  
[384.32 - 389.88] wallet a payment Gateway and a payment processor 
as a digital wallet PayPal allows you users to  
[389.88 - 395.40] store funds and use them for future purchases 
or transfers as a payment Gateway it connects  
[395.40 - 400.80] Merchants to financial institutions facilitating 
online payments and as a payment processor it  
[400.80 - 406.44] handles actual transaction by routing payments 
through card networks or bank accounts unlike UPI  
[406.44 - 411.00] PayPal typically holds funds in an intermediate 
balance your PayPal wallet before transferring it  
[411.00 - 417.20] to your bank account the step introduces an 
extra lar that UPI bypasses entirely as UPI  
[417.20 - 422.80] facilitates instant bank to bank transfer with 
no intermediary balance for example when using  
[422.80 - 427.56] PayPal you will usually link a bank account debit 
card or credit card to Paypal when you receive a  
[427.56 - 432.44] payment the money is first held in your PayPal 
balance from there you can transfer it to your  
[432.44 - 438.68] bank account or use it directly for purchases in 
contrast UPI transfers funds immediately from One  
[438.68 - 444.36] bank account to another without holding money in a 
wallet alip is China&#39;s leading payment system and  
[444.36 - 450.64] is widely used for everything from shopping online 
to paying with QR codes in stores but unlike UPI  
[450.64 - 456.04] it holds funds in a wallet before spending or 
transferring adding an extra layer of friction  
[456.04 - 461.44] that UPI skips venmo is a social P2P payment 
platform that&#39;s popular in the US you&#39;ll link  
[461.44 - 465.84] your bank account debit card or credit card 
to send and receive payments between friends  
[465.84 - 471.52] or businesses and there is even a social fee to 
share transaction details with contacts however  
[471.52 - 477.20] like PayPal venmo holds money in your venmo 
balance until you transfer it to your bank while  
[477.20 - 483.24] venmo Works similarly to UPI in terms of peer to 
payments it often acts as an intermediary holding  
[483.24 - 488.00] money in your venmo balance Apple pay and Google 
pay allow users to make payments using their  
[488.00 - 493.32] mobile phones by linking their bank account or 
cards they work for in store purchases using NFC  
[493.32 - 498.92] or nearfield communication as well as for online 
payments they use encryption and tokenization to  
[498.92 - 504.60] ensure secure payments especially for contactless 
purchases but both Apple and Google p are primary  
[504.60 - 510.80] digital wallets for storing card details in India 
however there&#39;s a UPI version of Google pay which  
[510.80 - 516.20] integrates with the UPI infrastructure for direct 
bank-to-bank transfers but in other countries like  
[516.20 - 521.08] in the US it functions more like Apple pay 
UPI is actually similar to zel a real-time  
[521.08 - 527.08] bank transfer system used in the US but their 
infrastructure differ UPI is managed by npci in  
[527.08 - 533.68] India it operates via API based architecture that 
handles massive volumes with low latency zel on  
[533.68 - 539.44] the other hand operates in the US using the a 
network while both systems offer peer-to-peer  
[539.44 - 545.56] transfers upi&#39;s API infrastructure allows for 
faster real-time Bank settlements whereas zel&#39;s  
[545.56 - 550.36] AC Network settles transactions in near real 
time and if you&#39;re interested in learning more  
[550.36 - 556.28] about zel and similar real-time payment systems 
or want to dive deeper into how UPI was built in  
[556.28 - 560.92] my next video I&#39;ll break down how a system like 
UPI can be built from scratch we&#39;ll explore the  
[560.92 - 566.36] apis infrastructure and all the critical Parts 
you need to consider so don&#39;t forget to like
